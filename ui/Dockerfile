# Named .dev to underscore that this Dockerfile is only used to run the application locally

FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR '/usr/create-dapp/ui'

## copes the package.json file to working directory, split to ensure npm install and source file is separate
COPY package.json .

## this allows us to never need the `node_modules` folder locally, since all dependencies are installed within the docker kernel
RUN npm install

## split into a second command, to avoid installing + copying all files over at once
### Copy is unecessary here, since we are using volumes for the dev docker setup, leaving for production
COPY . .

## each of these represents a command, each comma represents a space
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
